## Overview

The dapp uses curated analytics from Flipside Crypto to list the most coolest people to chat with in the Cyber Samurai community using Dialect Labs's wallet-to-wallet chat. It is also built using Solana Foundation react wallet adapters, Nextjs Starter, and MongoDB. 

The dapp intends to enhance social connections between members.

## What's Next

We would like to implement the app across other NFT communities. Long-term, if you speak to a specific "combo" of NFT owners or NFT community members, you will get a reward. It will help increase social connections and collaboration between different NFT communities.
