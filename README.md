# solcombo

## Overview

The dapp uses curated analytics from Flipside Crypto to list the most coolest people to chat with in the Cyber Samurai community using Dialect Labs's wallet-to-wallet chat. It is also built using Solana Foundation react wallet adapters, Nextjs Starter, and MongoDB. 

The dapp intends to enhance social connections between members.

## Testing the application

Please use the live application https://solcombo.vercel.app/. If you opt to test it locally on localhost:3000, please follow these commands:

```
cd solcombo
yarn
yarn dev
```

## What's Next

We would like to implement the app across other NFT communities. Long-term, if you speak to a specific "combo" of NFT owners or NFT community members, you will get a reward. It will help increase social connections and collaboration between different NFT communities.
